# sega_cmp

This Rust crate provides an implementation of Sega's CMP [run-length encoding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Run-length_encoding) compression format. This format was created by Sega, and used in many Saturn games by Sega and third parties. This library aims to provide a 100%-compatible compressor able to be used to replace data in retail Saturn games.

This crate embeds C code written by [@MrConan1](https://github.com/MrConan1).
